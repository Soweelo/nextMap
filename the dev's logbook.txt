** using leaflet sources: https://react-leaflet.js.org/
    * first you should install leaflet :
        npm install leaflet
        npm install react-leaflet
        npm install -D @types/leaflet

** How to solve "window is not defined" errors in React and Next.js :
    Next.js is a React framework with pre-rendering abilities. This means that for every page, Next.js will try to generate the HTML of the page for better SEO and performance.
    This is why, if you're trying to do this:
    // components/Scroll.js
    window.addEventListener("scroll", function() {
      console.log("scroll!")
    });
    Then it will fail with "ReferenceError: window is not defined"
    Because in the Node.js world, window is not defined, window is only available in browsers.
    There are three ways to solve that:
        1. First solution: typeof
        2. Second solution: the useEffect hook
        3. Third solution: dynamic loading  --> best solution I tested for leaflet issue I'd say!!
        Suppose you created a Map component using leaflet library
        In pages/index.js where wish import the map, just add:
            const Map = dynamic(
              () => {
                return import("../components/Map");
              },
              { ssr: false }
            );
        Then in the index.js return() part just call  <Map /> as usual component!
        Works!!!

** don't forget to include the leaflet css file :
    you can either add leaflet.css in public and link it in index.js    or copy leaflet documentation external link to css
** lastly, add a .leaflet-container{ width:100%; height:100%} in your own project style

** not recommended to add stylesheet  directly in index.js :(
    instead create a _document.js in pages folder.
    source : https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document


** FOR "No Sync Scripts" ERROR , implying A synchronous script was used which can impact your webpage's performance, Use the Script component with the right loading strategy to defer loading of the script until necessary:
    Instead of adding script in index or _document, ad Script component in your page:
    ex:
        import Script from 'next/script'

        function Home() {
          return (
            <div class="container">
              <Script src="https://third-party-script.js"></Script>
              <div>Home Page</div>
            </div>
          )
        }

        export default Home

*** React Leaflet: Custom event "onClick" for Marker component:
    * onClick doesn't work anymore in react-leaflet v3
    * useMapEvent(s) applies to the map instance, not to UI components like Marker. To register an event handler on a Marker, you need to use the eventHandlers prop:
       ex:  <Marker
              data="customdata"
              position={position}
              icon={locationIcon}
              eventHandlers={{ click: onClick }}
            >
            </Marker>

*** Deployment for next
    * in package.json to "build" command the export one:  "build": "next build && next export"  https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export
    * run npm run build
    * now you got an "out" file with all you can push on server
